## Presentation

Docker Graph bot (DGB) is a Python tool whose goal is to automate the building of diagrams representing a dynamic Docker-based infrastructure. Indeed, if you draw manual diagrams, they will constantly be obsolete.
This is especially useful :
* If you want to be transparent to your users
* If you want to see the "big picture" of your infrastructure
* To check the coherence of container linking, naming schemes, networks...

DGB will produce diagrams (graphs) containing the following informations :
* Running containers, clustered by images
* Networks
* Port mappings
* Links between containers
* Traefik labels and backend port mappings, **when used**

Roughly, DGB follows these steps :

* The script periodically runs thanks to a cron job
* The Docker daemon is queried to retrieve interesting information about the launched containers
* If Traefik is used as a reverse-proxy, retrieve labels and port mapping to create a virtual link between containers
* A DOT file summarizing all gathered information is created
* One or several images are created depending on the configuration
* Post-generation actions are triggered, such as WebDAV/SFTP upload.

No private information should be leaked on the final diagrams. See below for an example diagram generated from one of the [Picasoft](https://picasoft.net) virtual machines.

## Configuration

All the configuration happens in `config/config.json`. You can use [`config.example.json`](./config_example.json) as a base.

### General parameters

* `organization` : mainly used for labels and file naming, this is the name of your organization/structure/whatever it is
* `merge` : a boolean which tells DDB if it should merge the generated diagrams in case you specify multiple hosts

Example :

```json
{
	"organization": "Picasoft",
	"merge": true
}
```
### Hosts

You can specify multiple hosts, for example if your infrastructure is made of several virtual machines.

In either case :
* `vm` field is used for labels and file naming
* `host_url` is the public URL of the virtual machine
* `exclude` is a list of container **names** that you may want to exclude from the diagram

If you want to build a diagram for a remote host, the Docker socket must be reachable through the network. TLS is mandatory here because this is basic security. See [the official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/https/) to learn how to expose your Docker socket.

Once you have your CA, server and client key, just fill the `ca_cert`, `cert` and `key` field with paths **relative** to your `<CONFIG_PATH>` folder (see [Usage](#usage)). Don't forget to specify the Docker socket port.

The main advantage to use multiple hosts is that it reduces the burden of maintaining an instance of DGB on each virtual machine. With only one instance, you can build, generate and upload all your diagrams at once.

Example with a remote host and a local host :
```json
"hosts": [
	{
		"vm": "<vm1>",
		"host_url": "<vm1>.tld",
		"port": 2376,
		"exclude": [
			"[container_name]"
		],
		"tls_config":
		{
			"ca_cert": "/CONFIG/ca.pem",
			"cert": "/CONFIG/cert.pem",
			"key": "/CONFIG/key.pem"
		}
	},
	{
		"vm": "<vm2>",
		"host": "localhost"
	}
],
```
### Actions

Actions are like post generation hooks. Each configured action is applied to DOT or PNG generated files.

For now, there is only two available actions : upload all generated PNG diagrams to
* A WebDAV compatible server (*e.g.* NextCloud).
* A SFTP server

Examples

```json
"actions": [
	{
		"type": "webdav",
		"hostname": "https://example.com/nextcloud/remote.php/dav/files/<login>",
		"login": "login",
		"password": "password",
		"remote_path": "graph_output"
	},
	{
		"type": "sftp",
		"hostname": "https://sftp.tld",
		"port": 2222,
		"login": "login",
		"password": "password",
		"remote_path": "graph_output"
	}
]
```

Note that `remote_path` is just a relative path to the "home" directory of the WebDAV user or the SFTP user.

### Color scheme

This is pretty self-explanatory. Just use hexadecimal values to control the look-and-feel of your diagrams.

## Usage

DGB is distributed as a Docker image and is ready for use. You just need to provide a valid configuration file and TLS needed files if necessary.

You can pull the latest stable version from [the Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/chosto/graphbot) :

``` bash
$ docker pull chosto/graphbot
```

Or build the image from the repository :

```bash
$ git clone https://gitlab.utc.fr/picasoft/projets/graph-bot.git
$ cd graph-bot
$ docker build -t chosto/graph-bot .
```

Then, create required directories :

```bash
$ # These are the bind-mounted directories. If you change their names, change bind-mounts !.
$ mkdir config output
$ mv config_example.json config/config.json
```

Those are the environment variables that you can override at your convenience :
* `CONFIG_PATH` : mount point of the configuration volume
* `OUTPUT_PATH` : mount point of the output volume
* *Optional* : `CRON_CONFIG` : cron setting (*e.g.* `0 0 * * *` for every day at midnight). If you don't provide it, DGB will execute once and stop.

If you want to use Docker Compose (recommended), use the one provided in this repository and tune the environment variables in the file :

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
$ docker logs -f graph-bot
# And voil√† !
```

If you don't want to use Docker Compose, you can still use the following Docker commands :

```bash
$ docker network create graphbot
$ docker run -d --name graph-bot \
	--volume "$(pwd)/config:/config" --volume "$(pwd)/output:/output" --volume "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
	-e CONFIG_PATH='/config' -e OUTPUT_PATH='/output' -e CRON_CONFIG='0 0 * * *'
	--restart unless-stopped --net graphbot graph-bot
```

Each time DGB is runned, `OUTPUT_PATH` will be updated with new DOT and PNG files.
If `merge` is `true`, filenames will use `organization` field, `vm` otherwise.

DGB also generates a legend with the corresponding color scheme, it can be found at `OUTPUT_PATH/legend.png`.

## Security considerations

DGB is launched as `root`, especially because private keys will probably we own by `root` on the host with permissions `600` (and they **should be**).

Also, the Docker socket is mounted inside the container so that DGB can query the running containers. Mounting the Docker socket is equivalent to :
* Allowing any modification of all containers, images, volumes...
* Giving a `root` access **to the host** itself ! (with little tricks)

As a consequence, it is mandatory to keep DGB in an isolated Docker network, without exposed port (I cannot see a reason to do so).
Also, when you use remote host, you also give a `root` access to these hosts to DGB. You must ensure that each person than can access your DGB instance (*i.e.* in `docker` group on the host running DGB) has a `root` or equivalent access on all hosts, otherwise you expose yourself to privilege escalation.

## Limitations

If you run a lot of containers across multiple hosts, the final diagrams may be unreadable. Indeed, GraphViz is not made to manage vertically aligned clusters and the final diagram will be too wide. If so, you may want to set `merge` to `false` and generate a single diagram per host.

Also, containers in multiple networks will be improperly rendered as if they belong to a single network.

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcomed. I am not a developer, so feel free to give feedback, improve the code or develop new features.

* `render.py` contains the code needed to put diagrams together and generate images
* `build.py` contains the code to build diagrams themselves, with DOT python library
* `actions.py` is the place to put all post generation hooks
